# Data-visualizer-
A simple AWS project which utitilizes AWS S3 buckets and AWS Quicksight. The dataset we will be using is amazon bestseller dataset but any dataset can be used. We store the files inside S3 bucket, which then we pull through the quicksight menu. This can then be used to create visualizations like power-bi from the columns used in the dataset or any other graphs we want too.
